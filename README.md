# Welcome to the server-side repository of the Uyn BOT server!

This is the code of Uyn BOT's data server. This is very easy to configure and easy to use, and it also supports any PHP server and hosting you want.

## Configuration

Go to the `Config.php` file and define your MySQL configuration and the server token. Make sure not to share it with anyone.

For the MySQL server, import the `UynServer.sql` file to your MySQL database and you can rename it into anything you like. Make sure to rename it in those server files.

## Uses

After configuration, just upload it into any PHP server and hosting that you want. You can use Heroku as a PHP hosting because you know, it is very good :))
